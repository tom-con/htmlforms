    <p>Welcome knowledge-seeker. You seem to have stumbled upon this <strong>informative lesson on web forms.</strong> Let's get into it.</p>
    <h3>Wat is a <strong>web form</strong>?</h3>
    <p>A <strong>web form</strong> are the main way of getting information from your user into your application. Sometimes this information goes to a server to be saved in a database. Sometimes it's stored just in the browser. Look. Here are some sites that use forms.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/GeoGod/allharrypotter">Harry Potter Top 200 Sporcle</a>
      </li>
      <!-- Add in two more sites that have forms -->
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Form Elements: Control Tags</h3>
    <p><strong>Control tags</strong> are tags that build elements which a user can control to give information. There are four control tags:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>input</li>
      <li>select</li>
      <li>textarea</li>
      <li>button</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>input</h3>
    <p>The default and most common type of input element is the single-line text field. We specify this using the <strong>type</strong> attribute and set it to "text".</p>
    <input type="text">
    <!-- Find 4-6 other input types (not radio or checkboxes) and put them below with brief descriptions of what they do. -->
    <p>Let's take a closer look at two specific input types: <strong>radio</strong> and <strong>checkboxes</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Radio buttons</strong> are used when the user can only <strong>select one choice</strong> from many. Setting the input's value will allow you to access it using JavaScript, for example.
    <!-- Find out how to adjust the name attribute so that only one radio button out of the three may be selected and add a sentence or two describing the rule. -->
    </p>
    <input type="radio" name="" value=""> Select me <br>
    <input type="radio" name="" value=""> Not me <br>
    <input type="radio" name="" value=""> Aaaand...not me <br>
    <p><strong>Checkboxes</strong> are used when multiple choices can be selected.</p>
    <!-- Below, create three checkboxes with different values, and add an attribute to one of them that makes it checked by default. Add a paragraph describing some rules you found when setting checkbox attributes. -->
    <h3>select</h3>
    <p>Select boxes allow the user to choose from a set of options.</p>
    <!-- Create a select box with three options and have the third one be selected by default -->
    <!-- Create a select box with three options and have the second and third one be selected by default -->
    <h3>textarea</h3>
    <p>Here's a textarea. You can drag the lower-right corner to adjust its height and width.</p>
    <!-- Find out what other attributes you can control to set a default width and height. -->
    <textarea></textarea>
    <h3>button</h3>
    There are three types of buttons:
    <ul>
      <li>button - good ol' button.<br>
        <button type="button">Just a butt...on</button>
      </li>
      <li>submit <!-- Describe the point of a submit button when nested in a form and include an example -->

      </li>
      <li>reset <!-- Describe the point of a reset button when nested in a form and include an example -->

      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
